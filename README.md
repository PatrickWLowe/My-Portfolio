#### A webpage showing a basic Portfolio 

## Technologies Used

## Description

#### I was asked to build a website from scratch showing coding projects I have worked on for potential employers in order to showcase my work.

## Getting Setup

#### Make a new Repository in GutHub.
#### Clone the new Repository to your local device using GitBash or Terminal.
#### Open the repo's folder in Visual Studio Code
#### Create an index.html file, and an assets folder that contains an images file and css file.
#### Start coding your new Portfolio website from scratch using the paramenters below:
#### GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
#### WHEN I load their portfolio
#### THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
#### WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
#### THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
#### WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
#### THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
#### WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
#### THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
#### WHEN I click on the images of the applications
#### THEN I am taken to that deployed application
#### WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
#### THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
